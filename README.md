# pygame-3d-movement
An extension of the 3d render engine i made for a [previous project](https://github.com/diamondTheRat/donut.py)

## Upgrades:
- better rendering;
- camera can now look up and down;
- you can move the camera with your mouse;
- added collisions between rectangular prisms(boxes) along with "movement"
- terrain mesh generator(not really complete, just a test)
